    This should be applied to QSpinbox, QDoubleSpinBox and QComboBox objects
    where you want the mouse-wheel to be usable AFTER you've clicked to focus
    the widget, but should not trigger inadvertent events when you've simply
    "scrolled past" the widget within a QScrollArea.

    In contrast, MouseWheelFilter prevents the mouse-wheel from ever affecting
    the widget (appropriate for QVerticalSliders).
