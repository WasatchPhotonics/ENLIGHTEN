##
# Encapsulates a single saved measurement from one spectrometer, comprising
# a ProcessedReading (optionally containing the original Reading object that 
# generated it), metadata (Settings), as well as a ThumbnailWidget for display 
# on the capture bar.  Note that other than the ProcessedReading, 
# SpectrometerApplicationState is NOT retained in the Measurement.
#
# A Measurement object is created when:
#
# - the user clicks the "Acquire" button on the GUI
# - a BatchCollection triggers one or more Acquire events
# - the user loads a spectrum from disk
#
# If a Measurement is loaded from disk, it will not contain the original Reading
# object.  Also, the metadata may be limited.
#
# If a Measurement is generated live, it will also have a reference to the 
# spectrometer which generated it.
#
# Regardless of whether the Measurement was generated from a live capture 
# (Acquire) or loaded from disk, a ThumbnailWidget will be generated (not 
# necessarily instantly) for visualization.
#
# As some Measurements may be displayed in different x-axis coordinates, we need
# to store the "current / selected / displayed" x-axis for the Measurement. I'm
# tentatively thinking to do that in the ThumbnailWidget, as it's kind of an 
# attribute of the trace, but we'll see.
#
# I am not sure whether we really need separate Thumbnail and ThumbnailWidget
# classes, other than that they are literally very different things (the one
# is a pyqtgraph export, the other is a QWidget), even though one is typically
# displayed within the other.
#
# Given that there are multiple ways to create a Measurement, with somewhat
# different attributes and controlled background timing, a MeasurementFactory
# is provided to separately encapsulate the process of construction.
#
# Each Measurement has a .measurement_id, which is permanent.  The id is used 
# as the default label attribute (both for file basenames and for on-screen 
# display), but the label may be subsequently changed by the user.  
#
# @par Pathnames and Persistence
#
# There is no simple .pathname attribute for the Measurement, as one Measurement 
# may have been saved to any or all of several different file types.  
# 
# AT PRESENT, it is assumed that the creation of a Measurement will include 
# saving the Measurement to one or more output files at creation, but this is not 
# a long-term requirement (we may decide to support "session traces" which are 
# never actually persisted to disk; Spectrasuite and OceanView have these).
#
# There is a .pathnames set which aggregates all the pathnames which are known 
# related to this Measurement, though it is not guaranteed complete in the case 
# of loaded files from other sessions.  (Ideally all such files would contain
# the original measurement_id somewhere within them, though not necessarily in 
# the pathname.)
#
# If a Measurement has been deserialized from disk, it will have a 
# .source_pathname attribute to indicate the source file from which it was
# instantiated.
#
# Note that the application caps how many Measurements are visible in the
# Thumbnail bar at any given time, and currently ENLIGHTEN's file-management
# operations (rename, delete etc) only function on visible Thumbnails, so if
# you're streaming vast BatchCollections to disk such that they get rotated out
# of our buffer, you'll have to rename / delete them through other means.
#
# @par Renaming Measurements
#
# Renaming Measurements is a potentially thorny issue.  Early versions of
# ENLIGHTEN renamed the output file(s) when you changed the label of on-screen 
# thumbnail, and customers wish to retain that ability (ticket from 2019-07-19).
#
# However, there is all kinds of ugliness down this hole: 
#
# - What if you were appending measurements to one big CSV? 
# - What if you loaded the measurement for comparison from archival spectra? 
# - What if you loeaded the measurement from a big export file?
#
# My current decision is that we will retain the historical ability to rename
# any file(s) saved from the given Measurement IFF the files were CREATED
# by the CURRENT ENLIGHTEN session; OR if the spectrum was loaded from a 
# single file (not an export or appended collection).
#
# This distinction is made when Measurements are loaded or saved, and 
# tracked via a renameable_files list.  It's not as simple as checking
# whether the spectrum was created or loaded, because it matters what
# type of file it was loaded from, or which type of file it was saved to.
#
# A consequence of this design is that if you initially have CSV and XLS
# files saved, you can rename the thumbnail to "apple" and both CSV and XLS
# files will be renamed to apple.csv and apple.xls.  However, if you then
# clear your thumbnails (or quit / relaunch ENLIGHTEN) and load apple.csv
# from disk, if you then rename the file to banana.csv, it will NOT likewise
# rename apple.xls to banana.xls.
#
# Also, relabeling the Measurement on-screen, and even renaming the underlying
# file artifacts DOES NOT re-write or update the file contents.  The "label"
# field in the file metadata is not updated.  It would not be particularly hard 
# to re-save the file, but this seems like it would have many risks if a newer
# version of ENLIGHTEN changed the file format, or if there had been extra data
# in the file (ignored during a load operation, or added by the user post-save)
# which would then be destroyed.
#
# @par Thumbnails and resources
#
# Originally, ENLIGHTEN had no "Measurements", only "Thumbnails" -- the 
# spectra was literally stored (only) as the y-values of the thumbnail
# graph, with no x-axis, no metadata etc.  So it was an improvement to
# move forward to "Measurements with Thumbnails".  But there is a resource
# issue with EVERY Measurement having a ThumbnailWidget...what if we run
# a weekend collection taking 250,000 samples?
#
# A better architecture might be just "Measurements" (the data), plus
# a ThumbnailBar able to dynamically generate and display ThumbnailWidgets
# on scroll events (similar to a Swift TableView, where cells are populated
# as they scroll into view, and are released when offscreen).
#
# And possibly move away from the heavy "Widget" (with a couple Frames, 
# Buttons, the pyqtgraph etc) to a simpler table or tree view which would 
# probably use less memory.
#
# For now, I'm compromising by treating the on-screen thumbnails as a ringbuffer,
# and kicking-off old Measurements (from memory, not disk) when we exceed a
# limit.
#
# Note that the MeasurementFactory automatically saves new Measurements to disk
# (per SaveOptions) as they are created from Spectrometers, BEFORE they are 
# handed to Measurements for addition to the Thumbnail bar.  The process of
# creating a Measurement (from Spectrometer) and saving it to disk is atomic,
# so there is no need to worry that automatic deletion of Measurements for
# resource management will cause data to be lost.
#
# @par Exploits
#
# It is ASSUMED that the user used the same Settings (integration time, boxcar 
# smoothing, scan averaging etc) when taking the 'raw', 'dark' and 'reference'
# component spectra in generation of the 'processed' component.  Only a single
# Settings object is retained for the entire ProcessedReading, which is copied
# when the Measurement is created.  
#
# That is, if the user does something like this, the wrong integration time would
# be stored with the Measurement:
#
# 1. set integration time 100ms
# 2. pause scope
# 3. set integration time 200ms
# 4. click "Acquire" to save the current on-screen (paused) measurement
#
# There are various ways we could address this weakness (e.g., snap a Deep Copy 
# of Settings on pause()), but it's not a priority at this time.
#
# @todo more robust / defined behavior with duplicate labels across Measurements
#       (currently has some graphing glitches when adding / removing traces)
