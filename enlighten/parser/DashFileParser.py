    @endverbatim
    
    As we step through the rows of the file, we'll need to maintain last-seen
    metadata about each spectrometer.  As we step through the line, we'll 
    generate Measurements from blocks that can be anywhere from individual
    lines (processed) to 7-line blocks:
    
    - pixels        (discard)
    - wavelengths   (discard)
    - wavenumbers   (discard)
    - processed     (note)
    - raw
    - dark
    - reference
    
    Note that technically the expanded pixels, wavelengths and wavenumbers 
    lines are discarded, because the prefixed line metadata contains wavecal
    coeffs, pixel count and excitation wavelength, so lines with a "Note" of
    those values will be discarded.
    
    The all-important "processed" line is assumed to be the FIRST line of a new
    Line Number including prefixed metadata (timestamp etc) which has NOT been 
    discarded (e.g. named pixels/wavelengths/wavenumbers, which seems unlikely).
    
    So we'll maintain state for each spectrometer, generating new Measurements
    from the latest-known spectrometer data each time we encounter a new block.
    
    Technically we never end up re-using old DashSpectrometer objects (we 
    regenerate them from each new 'processed' line), so there's really no need to 
    maintain the self.specs hash...we could just make it self.current_spec.
    
    @par Exploits
    
    If the user has manually assigned a "note" field of "pixels", "wavelengths",
    or "wavenumbers" (unlikely), the given spectrum will not be correctly read.
    (Most likely, the "raw" version will be read and assumed to be "processed",
    which isn't so bad).
    
    I _think_ the algorithm will be fine if the user assigns a note of "raw", 
    "dark", "reference" etc, because the ACTUAL components with those labels
    should be read AFTER the processed row (which can have an arbitrary name,
    including those given).
