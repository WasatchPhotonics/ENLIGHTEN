# This class encapsulates ENLIGHTEN's interface to KnowItAll
#
# @par Design Considerations
#
# This needs to be in a background thread, so we can process newly acquired 
# spectra when there is no pending match in-progress.  Therefore, we're borrowing
# some architecture from WasatchDeviceWrapper.
#
# The subprocess will communicate with KIAConsole via the text protocol used by
# KIAConsole.  The subprocess will communicate with the MainProcess.KnowItAllWrapper
# via picklable Python objects.
#
# Currently no attempt has been made to integrate this into the RamanMatching
# class as an alternate matching engine, though it certainly should be.  Right
# now I'm just providing a quick "proof-of-concept" integration to show that
# the executable and linked library and signature database can indeed be 
# accessed from within ENLIGHTEN in timely fashion.
#
# @par Multiprocessing Shenanigans
#
# Note that multiprocessing.Process().start() explodes if the Wrapper contains
# callbacks to Controller.  (Controller is a QThingy that can't be pickled.)
#
# @todo support authentication (look for "expected" within match results)
# @todo support good/bad (look for known-good and known-bad results, returning binary indicator)
