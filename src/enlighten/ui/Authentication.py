class Authentication:
    """
    This class encapsulates the process of "logging-in" to ENLIGHTEN and enabling
    or displaying GUI widgets which should only be exposed to certain user classes.
    
    Currently there are four levels setup:
    
    - BASIC 
        - default, no authentication required
        - user cannot edit ANY of the fields in the EEPROMEditor (display-only)
        - user can "save .ini", and edit desired fields directly in that file 
          (only affects their PC, in their Documents directory)
        - cannot write EEPROM
    
    - ADVANCED    
        - password "wasatch" (hardcoded)
        - enables "Advanced Users" controls 
            - some manufacturing tests and experimental features
            - excitation spinner on Laser Control Widget
        - allows user to edit "safe" fields in the EEPROM editor (see EEPROM.is_editable)
        - editted "safe" fields can be saved to .ini
        - still cannot write EEPROM
    
    - OEM
        - password "wasatchoem" (hardcoded)
        - displays "Save EEPROM" button
        - EEPROM can be written, but EEPROM.write_eeprom() method will only update
          "is_editable" fields in the page buffers before writing
    
    - PRODUCTION
        - password NOT hardcoded (ask Zieg or production team)
        - all EEPROM fields editable
        - EEPROM can be written
    
    You'll note we're not too worried about security, hard-coding passwords and
    hashes and all.  The truth is that our full USB API is (deliberately) published
    for application developers in ENG-0001, and the full EEPROM layout is defined 
    publicly in ENG-0034, so essentially any knowledgable user can do anything 
    anyway.  This is more a matter of keeping dangerous / confusing / experimental 
    options on a high shelf so new users don't randomly click buttons just to see 
    what they do.
    
    @par Relationship to Advanced Options
    
    They are disconnected and orthogonal (see Advanced Options docs).
