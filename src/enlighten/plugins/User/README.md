Wasatch Photonics will never create plugins within this folder. 

Therefore, users are free to put their own plugins within this folder, and new 
versions of ENLIGHTEN will never accidentally overwrite them.

(Which could theoretically happen if a user happened to create their own plugin
called Raman/RemoveCosmicLines.py, and Wasatch later coincidentally released 
their own plugin with the same filename.)
